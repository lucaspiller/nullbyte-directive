# Factions

No bloc in this era survives by purity alone. Every major power swears loyalty
to Exodus Protocol, and every one of them bends around its edges to keep cargo
moving, habitats supplied, and political authority intact.

What differs is not whether they comply, but where they draw the hard line:
inside the authority path, at the trust boundary, or only where failure becomes
too public to ignore.

## Sino Orbital Authority (SOA)

SOA runs the tightest high-volume corridors in cislunar space. Their inspectors
are feared for a reason: authority-path systems must pass strict, repeatable
checks, and exceptions are treated as a threat to state legitimacy, not just a
technical risk.

Outside that hard core, SOA is flexible in a very specific way. Advisory stacks
can be aggressive, proprietary, and fast, as long as they stay licensed and
fully visible to central telemetry. That split lets SOA promise both safety and
throughput, then sell the world the infrastructure that makes the promise seem
credible.

Its critics call this compliance theater backed by coercive finance. Partners
who miss audits can lose lane priority, financing, or market access in the same
week. SOA calls that disciplined governance.

The conglomerates that carry this model are Tiangong Infrastructure Group, Jade
Harbor Logistics, Long March Reactor Systems, Red Meridian Avionics, and Golden
Lattice Materials.

## Bharat Interplanetary Commission (BIC)

BIC was built for the day a distant habitat has to fix itself before help
arrives. Its doctrine keeps Exodus boundaries strict in life-critical paths, but
it protects local operator autonomy and open interfaces everywhere else. In
practice, that means more adapters, more interoperable parts, and fewer single
points of political failure.

The strength of the system is recovery speed. BIC habitats can reroute, repair,
and improvise under disruption because their stacks were designed to tolerate
mixed vendors and imperfect conditions. The weakness is variance: a resilient
federation does not produce uniform quality, and frontier retrofits can drift
right up to the edge of doctrine.

Stricter blocs read that drift as recklessness. BIC reads it as the real cost of
keeping people alive beyond easy rescue range.

Its industrial backbone is Vikram Systems Cooperative, Indus Propellant and
Cryogenics, Surya Habitat Works, Kaveri Transit Exchange, and Astra-Bharat
Fabrication.

## Eurasian Continuity Pact (ECP)

ECP governs like the Quiet Burn is still unfolding in slow motion. Its position
is simple: ambiguity is a systemic hazard, and hazards compound faster than
politics can react. So it enforces conservative control baselines, heavy
inspection, and certification courts with real embargo power.

This posture lowers uncertainty inside core habitats, but it taxes everything
else. Turnaround slows, trade friction rises, and black markets thrive anywhere
procedural certainty outruns material reality. ECP accepts that drag as the
price of civil continuity.

The bloc's hardest contradiction appears during emergencies. Waivers that keep a
corridor alive can also undermine the hardline legitimacy ECP depends on. Each
exception solves a local crisis while weakening the story that rules are
non-negotiable.

ECP is sustained by the Continuity Certification Bureau, Kaz Heavy Industries,
Aurora Relay and Navigation, Novaya Shieldworks, and the Pact Resource
Syndicate.

## Helios Lane Systems (HLS)

HLS is not a state, but it can make states behave like clients. Its model is
precise: comply rigorously at authoritative trust boundaries, then optimize
everything above them with proprietary routing, forecasting, and contract
control.

When lanes are stable, HLS is expensive convenience. When lanes fracture, it
becomes indispensable. Embargo workarounds, outage reroutes, crisis insurance,
and replacement stock all run through Helios channels, usually at prices only
panic can justify.

That leverage creates permanent suspicion. Rivals accuse HLS of shaping markets
and inspection outcomes through data asymmetry. HLS answers that it merely sees
system risk sooner than governments do and charges accordingly.

Its core operators are the Helios Risk and Routing Bureau, Aegis Insurance
Corporation, Coldforge Salvage and Refit, Nadir Data Utilities, and Palladium
Interface Works.

## System Dynamics

SOA and ECP often cooperate on strict authority-path enforcement, then compete
immediately over who sets certification terms and governs strategic corridors.
BIC trades with both while resisting deep lock-in to either model, which makes
it a critical partner and a frequent political target.

HLS profits from this fragmentation by selling coordination across incompatible
regimes. That service is real, but so is the risk: whenever private optimization
capacity becomes too central, public safety decisions start to inherit private
incentives.

Most system conflicts never become declared war. They appear as inspection
standoffs, telemetry disputes, sabotage, embargo cascades, contract betrayal,
and contested access to the nodes that keep stations breathing.
