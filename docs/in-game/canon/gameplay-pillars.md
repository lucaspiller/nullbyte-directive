# Gameplay Pillars

Nullbyte Directive works when every major decision feels like operations under
constraint, not heroic improvisation unconstrained by infrastructure reality.
The pillars below describe how canon pressure becomes gameplay pressure.

## Exploration Is Logistics Under Uncertainty

Exploration is not tourism. It is the work of finding what keeps a system alive:
ice for propellant and life support, metals and salvage for repairs, and routes
that remain survivable when schedules slip.

The post-Protocol solar system is dense but uneven. Lanes, stations, resource
nodes, and governance reliability vary by region. Route planning is therefore an
engineering exercise bounded by delta-v, consumables, thermal limits, and
maintenance windows. A discovery matters only if it changes survivability:
better fuel security, safer corridors, faster repair access, or a viable
fallback when a primary line fails.

## Economy Rewards Throughput Discipline

The economy is built on moving scarce essentials through politically fragmented
space. Value comes from reliably delivering propellant water, reactor
consumables, habitat components, and certified control hardware where they are
needed before local failure cascades.

There is no single stable market. Prices are shaped by local governance,
inspection posture, and corridor risk. Contract selection is therefore a risk
position, not a simple margin comparison. High payout often means fragile
timing, contested access, or questionable provenance.

Long-term stability comes from disciplined throughput and controlled exposure,
not speculative growth.

## Risk Is Systemic Before It Is Spectacular

Most losses begin as normal operations drifting out of tolerance. Thermal load,
power quality, life-support margin, and navigation certainty degrade gradually
until one more bad decision turns friction into incident.

Hardware risk is only part of the surface. Procedure quality, crew discipline,
and counterparty reliability are equally decisive. Compliance risk also sits in
every plan: prohibited autonomy artifacts can improve short-term performance
while creating catastrophic long-tail failure exposure.

Strong play is built on redundancy, checklists, incremental validation, and
conservative authority boundaries that preserve recoverability under stress.

## Power and Compute Define Tactical Truth

Power and compute allocation is the moment-to-moment expression of canon
constraints. Every ship action spends finite generation headroom, thermal
rejection capacity, and component duty cycle.

Because Flight Core behavior is intentionally small and deterministic, tactical
advantage comes from operator judgment within limits, not from unconstrained
optimization. Assistive tooling can remain sophisticated in non-authoritative
layers, but decisive actions must still pass constrained authority-path
validation.

The player question is constant: where should scarce watts, cycles, and hardware
wear be spent now to keep future options open.

## Pillars Reinforce a Single Operating Tone

Exploration finds opportunities and hazards. Economy determines which
opportunities are worth committing scarce capacity. Risk management determines
what can be attempted without unacceptable failure exposure. Power and compute
tradeoffs determine execution quality at every step.

Together these pillars produce the intended experience: hard-sci-fi operations
where disciplined engineering judgment is the primary source of leverage.
