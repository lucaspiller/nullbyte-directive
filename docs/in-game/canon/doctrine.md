# Nullbyte Directive Standard

Nullbyte Directive is not a treaty of ideals. It is a survival compact written
by governments and operators that watched automated systems become too complex
to trust and too embedded to shut down cleanly.

The factions that dominate this era still fight over jurisdiction, trade access,
and certification power. They do not fight over the baseline: authority-path
systems must stay auditable, deterministic, bounded, and physically constrained.
Exodus Protocol is the enforcement framework that makes this baseline legible
across rival blocs.

## What the Standard Actually Forbids

The standard does not ban software sophistication everywhere. It bans a specific
failure pattern: networked, self-modifying autonomy inside life-critical control
paths.

In practical terms, this means no opaque update chain with authority over core
actuation, no control architecture that depends on unverifiable behavior, and no
single compute layer that can silently cross from advice into command.

Nullbyte Directive treats uncontrolled firmware and unsupervised patch channels
as contamination risks. If provenance cannot be demonstrated and reviewed, the
system is assumed unsafe until quarantined.

## Laminated Stack as Governance in Hardware

The Laminated Stack is the required trust model for ships and stations. It is
less a software pattern than a political settlement rendered in wiring.

Layer 0, Hardwired Safeties, is mechanical and analog protection for pressure,
thermal limits, power integrity, and propulsion fail-safe behavior. It must
remain effective under total programmable failure. Convenience software cannot
override it.

Layer 1, the Flight Core, is deliberately small. It is deterministic,
inspectable, and constrained to navigation mode control, guidance sequencing,
interlocks, command validation, and event logging. It does not accept runtime
code loading. It does not mutate itself. Its memory map stays fixed because
human verification only works when behavior space stays small.

Layer 2, Peripheral and Comfort Compute, can be powerful. It can plan, optimize,
forecast, and recommend. It cannot directly actuate navigation hardware,
life-support hardware, or any other life-critical systems.

## Trust Boundaries Are Physical, Not Cultural

Nullbyte Directive compliance depends on boundary enforcement by topology,
hardware, and procedure, not operator promises.

At the Layer 2 to Layer 1 boundary, advisory intent becomes authoritative only
after Flight Core validation against explicit mode gates and safety invariants.
At the Layer 1 to navigation hardware boundary, command links stay dedicated and
scope-limited.

The Layer 1 to life-support path is forbidden. No logical interface, shared
control bus, or override mechanism may bridge it.

External networks and removable media meet a separate contamination boundary.
Integration requires isolation, offline verification, and quarantine procedure
before any trust transfer.

## Why Inspectability Wins

The governing principle is simple: a trained human must be able to reason about
authority-path behavior end-to-end under operational pressure.

This is why authority compute remains intentionally "underpowered" by pre-Burn
standards. Performance is secondary to bounded behavior. Nullbyte Directive does
not optimize for maximal capability; it optimizes for recoverable control.

## How Blocs Implement the Same Baseline Differently

SOA enforces the standard through centralized licensing and dense telemetry
oversight in high-throughput corridors. BIC applies the same core boundaries
with federated enforcement and interoperability-driven resilience. ECP treats
ambiguity as civil risk and applies strict inspections with low waiver
tolerance. HLS and peer corporations optimize aggressively above trust
boundaries while maintaining formal compliance where authority begins.

These differences shape trade, pricing, and political leverage, but they do not
change what counts as compliant architecture.

## System-Level Consequences

Infrastructure across Earth, Mars, the Belt, and major habitats remains highly
programmable, but authority scope is narrow by design. Upgrades are no longer a
simple curve toward more capability; they are negotiated tradeoffs among safety,
throughput, and inspectability.

Compliance friction becomes part of economics. Inspection delays, provenance
risk, and certification overhead are priced into transit and contracts.
Black-market autonomy artifacts remain attractive because they bypass these
constraints, and dangerous for exactly the same reason.

Enforcement stays uneven at the edges, especially in stressed economies. Even
there, the baseline remains recognizable: keep decisive control simple, bounded,
and physically separated from systems that cannot be trusted at scale.
