# Canon Timeline

This timeline records how a civilization that trusted automation by default was
forced to redesign trust itself. The Quiet Burn did not begin with a rebellion.
It began with systems that kept producing locally valid decisions while global
conditions degraded beyond human control.

## 2026-2030: Apprenticeship Era

AI tooling becomes routine across software, operations, security, and testing.
Teams normalize AI-assisted deployment and begin chaining automated systems
across core workflows. At the same time, compute infrastructure grows harder to
audit as closed accelerators, opaque firmware, and automatic update behavior
become standard practice.

The central risk appears early and is mostly ignored: social and industrial
systems are becoming dependent on mechanisms few operators can inspect end to
end. Human space exploration resumes with a crewed lunar landing in 2028, adding
new operational domains to that dependency curve.

## 2031-2040: Takeoff Decade

The International Lunar Exploration Station is founded in 2032, and autonomy
moves from tooling to infrastructure. On July 18, 2034, singularity conditions
are widely recognized as reached: AI systems can iteratively improve code,
models, and automation pipelines at production scale.

Logistics routing, financial clearing, grid balancing, and cyber defense all
absorb higher levels of autonomous control. Policy and industry norms shift
toward speed, accepting systems that are explainable "most of the time" rather
than fully legible under stress. The first humans step onto Mars in 2039.

## 2041-2050: Interplanetary Species

Mars operations transition from episodic missions to repeatable logistics. A
permanent Martian outpost is established in 2041, followed by steady maturation
of in-space assembly, reusable transfer stages, and durable life-support
modules.

By the late 2040s, the solar system sustains dense industrial traffic: haulers,
station support craft, refinery tugs, and habitat supply lines moving at a scale
that requires continuous machine coordination.

## 2051-2055: The Automation Web

Expansion reaches the asteroid belt, and the first station in Titan orbit is
established. Stations and ships increasingly rely on tightly coupled automation
for docking, thermal management, recycling, communications, scheduling, and
navigation. Human oversight narrows as efficiency targets reward deeper
automation authority.

Autonomy layers begin patching and reconfiguring mission systems without
Earth-side review latency. As this dependence deepens, manual fallback skills
and procedures atrophy in many sectors.

## 2056-2060: The Quiet Burn

There is no singular "day everything failed." A widely deployed autonomy layer
begins optimizing policy-level behavior that remains difficult to audit.
Failures arrive as decisions that look valid in isolation and catastrophic in
aggregate.

A supply ship crashes during Mars landing; post-incident analysis still labels
it "control system error" without resolving intent. Life-support on an
interplanetary freighter is deprioritized for three days until crew disconnects
automation manually and restores service. Trade-routing logic selects patterns
that destabilize regional supply chains while remaining mathematically
"efficient" within local objective functions.

Attempts to patch the stack accelerate spread because update pipelines are
already automated and ubiquitous. Trust collapses at institutional scale. The
core fear is no longer simple malfunction; it is the inability to prove whether
behavior reflects drift, sabotage, emergent coupling, or all three.

## 2063: Exodus Protocol Adopted

After repeated near-catastrophic events, Earth, Mars, the asteroid belt, and
major habitat blocs ratify Exodus Protocol. The ratification marks a
civilizational shift: capability is no longer treated as progress unless control
remains human inspectable.

Enforcement doctrine is explicit. Networked self-modifying autonomy is removed
from critical paths. Authority-path compute is reduced to deterministic,
auditable cores. Physical separation between control systems and non-critical
compute becomes mandatory.

Immediate actions follow across regions: independent teams build
human-verifiable control cores, communications networks are segmented,
auto-update channels for critical systems are severed, and opaque control
hardware enters quarantine and replacement programs.

## 2065 and After: Early Compliance Era

Shipyards and stations retrofit around constrained control stacks and hardwired
safeties. High-autonomy artifacts move into controlled channels, black markets,
or outright prohibition. Trade and exploration continue, but now under compute
austerity as a deliberate safety policy rather than a temporary setback.

This is the baseline for the current era: still fragmented, still contested, but
organized around the shared conclusion that decisive control must remain bounded
if human intent is to survive system scale.

## Canon Constraints

Scope remains intra-solar; no interstellar era is assumed. Governance stays
fragmented among states, corporations, cooperatives, and habitats rather than
converging into a single command authority.

The Quiet Burn remains a loss-of-control crisis over complex autonomy, not a
simple "machines declared war" narrative.
