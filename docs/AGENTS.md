# Writing Guides

When writing or editing documents under `docs/`, follow the appropriate guide:

- **Technical docs** (specs, manuals, compliance docs under
  `docs/in-game/technical/`): follow `docs/design/technical-writing-guide.md`.
  Plain ASCII, 80-char line limit, in-game framing, prose before tables,
  rationale near constraints.

- **Everything else** (canon, world-building, factions, design briefs, lore,
  gameplay docs): follow `docs/design/narrative-writing-guide.md`. Prose over
  lists, concrete over abstract, 80-char line limit, no game-design language in
  in-world docs.

- **Canon consistency**: follow `docs/design/canon-rules.md` for naming,
  terminology, and cross-document alignment.

If adding doc references, use relative paths from the repo root, e.g.
`docs/in-game/canon/doctrine.md`.
